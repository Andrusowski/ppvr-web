# PPvR

[PPvR](https://ppvr.andrus.io/) is an alternative osu! ranking system based on the scores of scoreposts on the game's subreddit [/r/osugame](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/).


PPVR parses the scoreposts of the subreddit and calculates a score for each player based on the scores (up- and downvotes) of the scoreposts related to them. A ranking for scorepost authors is also available. For more details, check the [FAQ](https://ppvr.andrus.io/faq).
## Problems

If you can't find certain scoreposts, then there are severeal reasons why:
- The Player had a namechange before the launchdate of ppvr (17.09.2018)
- The Player got banned on osu! before the launchdate
- The title of the scorepost is badly formatted
- The player's total score is <100
- My script did something wrong

Most scoreposts that are missing are still saved in the database but in another table, so I can review them manually over time. If you want certain scorepost to be visible sooner, you can contact me through the methods mentioned down below and I will prioritize your request.

## Acknowledgements
Big thanks to pushshift.io, which made it possible to archive old scoreposts. Also thanks to [christopher-dG](https://github.com/christopher-dG) for making osu-bot, where I took some regular expressions and constants from.
