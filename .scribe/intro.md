# Introduction

PPvR public API

This is a really basic api to provide most of the data that is provided by PPvR.<br/>
All API calls are rate limited to <b>60 requests per minute</b> to ensure that the api is used responsibly. This is the only way I can keep it public.

<aside>As you scroll, you'll see code examples for working with the API in different programming languages in the dark area to the right (or as part of the content on mobile).
You can switch the language used with the tabs at the top right (or from the nav menu at the top left on mobile).</aside>
